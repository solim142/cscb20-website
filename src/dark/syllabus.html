        <h1>Academic Integrity/Plagiarism</h1>
        <p>All of the work you submit must be done by you, and your work must not be submitted by someone else. Plagiarism is academic fraud and is taken very seriously. The department uses software that compares programs for evidence of similar code. Please read the Rules and Regulations from the U of T Governing Council, especially the <a href="https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/policies/code-behaviour-academic-matters-july-1-2019">Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters</a>.</p>
        <p>Please do not cheat. It is unpleasant for everyone involved, including us. Here are a couple of general guidelines to help you avoid plagiarism:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Never look at another student's assignment solution, whether it is on paper or on the computer screen.</li>
            <li>Never show another student your assignment solution. This applies to all drafts of a solution and to incomplete solutions.</li>
            <li>The easiest way to avoid plagiarism is to only discuss the assignment with the CSCB20 TA, and your instructor.</li>
            <li>Getting any component of the solution (including a verbal step-by-step explanation of how to do it) from another student, social-networking apps e.g. WeChat, Discord or 'Mentoring' services, etc. is an academic offense.</li>
            <li>Read the following handout. for tips on how to stay out of trouble:
                <ul><li><a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/aacc/sites/utsc.utoronto.ca.aacc/files/tipsheets/AIM%20%20Tipsheet%20oct%202015.pdf">https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/aacc/sites/utsc.utoronto.ca.aacc/files/tipsheets/AIM%20%20Tipsheet%20oct%202015.pdf</a></li></ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Getting Help</h1>
        <p>Besides attending lectures, there are several ways to get help:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Piazza</b>: The purpose of the forum is to provide a place for students to discuss material and help each other with assistance and supervision from the TAs and course instructors. It is not a substitute for office hours, tutorials, or lectures. It is unreasonable to expect the TAs or instructors to continually hover over the forum just so that questions can be answered within minutes. Do not expect this. Do not post solutions to the forum – this includes assignments, tutorials. Helping each other is good, giving away solutions is not. Everyone in the forum is expected to behave professionally and with courtesy. The forum is not a place for venting frustration. It is a professional environment, and everyone will treat it in that way. Anyone caught behaving unprofessionally will have their access revoked.</li>
            <li><b>Tutorials</b>: Tutorials are a great way for you to get some hands-on practice at programming. Your TA will be a Database language (SQL) and web app related languages (Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript) expert – you should feel free to ask him/her questions during the tutorial. You will get required practice for solving assignment questions by doing the labs.</li>
            <li><b>Office Hours</b>: Stop by office hours to ask questions or to hear questions asked by other students. This is a great way to learn.</li>
            <li><b>Email</b>: As a last resort, feel free to email me. Please try to email me more than 24 hours in advance of a deadline; I make no promises that I will answer assignment-related emails within 24 hours of a deadline. If you are having trouble with the course material or if you need extra help, please do not hesitate to contact me. I will answer as soon as possible. Keep in mind that the closer to an assignment due date that you send an email, the longer you wait for a reply is likely to be, due to the large quantity of messages that I receive. Also, please follow these guidelines for email correspondence:
                <ol>
                    <li>Please read the announcements on the course website to see if your question has already been answered before sending me email.</li>
                    <li>Include a good subject. At the very least, include the course number in the subject of the email, and use a good topic (for example, "CSCB20: A1 question about Relational Algebra").</li>
                    <li>Sign your full name to the email.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1>Copyright in Instructional Settings</h1>
        <p>If a student wishes to tape-record, photograph, video-record or otherwise reproduce lecture presentations, course notes or other similar materials provided by instructors, he or she must obtain the instructor's written consent beforehand. Otherwise, all such reproduction is an infringement of copyright and is absolutely prohibited. In the case of private use by students with disabilities, the instructor's consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For more information on copyright and the University of Toronto, please visit the <a href="https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/copyright/copyright-resources-u-t">copyright page</a>.</p>

        <h1>On equity, Diversity, and Inclusion</h1>
        <p>The University of Toronto is committed to equity, human rights, and respect for diversity. All members of the learning environment in this course should strive to create an atmosphere of mutual respect where all members of our community can express themselves, engage with each other, and respect one another's differences. U of T does not condone discrimination or harassment against any persons or communities.</p>

        <h1>On accommodations</h1>
        <p>The University provides academic accommodations for students with disabilities in accordance with the terms of the Ontario Human Rights Code. This occurs through a collaborative process that acknowledges a collective obligation to develop an accessible learning environment that both meets the needs of students and preserves the essential academic requirements of the University's courses and programs. Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. If you have a disability that may require accommodations, please feel free to approach me and/or the Accessibility Services office.</p>
