# Problems & Improvements

Problem: Old page had a fixed width, smaller than a landscape screen, but not quite fit for mobile.
Improvement: Made the widths and heighs relative in the page, with some minimums, that adapt to the user's screen.

Problem: No quick access to MarkUs or the Assignment's contents. Can only do so through clicking on the assignments page first, and then the link.
Improvement: The navigation menu has direct links to MarkUs, and directly links to the specific assignments when hovering over the assignments option.

Problem: No dark mode for reading in the dark or at night.
Improvement: Created a dark mode of the page, along with a way to switch.

Problem: No course team page to find the TA contact information; only the instructor's.
Improvement: A course team page was created to display basic information about the course instructor and TAs.


# Challenges

1. A large problem was designing the navigation bar to be: useful buttons, stick to the top of the page, and display a dropdown menu from the position it is, at any point from the page, on top of working and looking good on mobile. The way it was solved was by dividing it into 3 parts: navbar, dropdown and mobile.
In the navbar, the best option was just a flex div that sticks to the top of the page, with all the contents in it, links, justified to spread out.
For the dropdown, it would take the position of the navbar and add a dropdown menu div that is absolute (relative to the viewer) below the option, using a div that contains that option for alignment.
The mobile menu was the hardest part, since it involved the use of media query. To switch between, the navbar for desktop is set to display:none to hide it, and a hidden menu, the mobile one, is displayed instead, which is triggered below an aspect ratio and below a width. Both menus do exist, but media query switches which is displayed and which isn't. Given the complexity of the navbar, the mobile menu was just set to be a simpler dropdown that shows when hovering over the menu icon. We were unfortunately unable to find another way that didn't involve JS to do so reliably.

2. Switching between light and dark mode. Given don't have any templates, the simplest way to "switch" between modes was to create a clone of all the pages, but switch the CSS colour variables, then, the button in the footer is a link to that page's other mode. In order to not have to update the nav menu, which would create confusion, the copy of the pages was put in a different folder, with all the same files, save for the CSS and having the dark and light mode of images such as the UofT logo.

3. One of the first concerns when creating the site was having a consistent palette for the site, with the flexibility of being able to change it for dark mode. To deal with it, we first picked 4 colours from the 2023 UofT colour guide for the light mode, and 4 that would be the opposite for the dark mode. The colours had to be in a sort of "scale" from darker to brighter, and 1 colour to do the highlights. Once the colours were picked, we needed a way to consistently implement it, which we used the variables in :root() for. This allowed us to create basic colours, and for whenever we needed, use the variables so that we could easily switch later, though because of not thinking of the name at first, "UofTlightblue" ended up as a dark blue in dark mode.
We applied the same methodology, creating global components in the CSS at first, that would apply to objects like h1, h2, h3 and p, and then being more specific whenever it was needed.

4. One challenge I faced while designing the Labs and Assignments pages was structuring the content without using traditional <table> elements. Since tables are commonly used for displaying structured data, recreating a similar layout using CSS Grid required careful planning. Initially, I struggled with ensuring that the grid elements aligned properly and that the spacing between them remained consistent. A major issue was that the grid stretched across the entire webpage, making the content appear too wide and difficult to read. I attempted to adjust the column widths manually, but this led to inconsistencies in alignment across different screen sizes. To resolve this, I set max-width: 50% on the grid container, ensuring that it did not take up more than half of the page. However, this alone did not fix the issue, as the grid was still left-aligned. To center it properly, I applied margin: auto;, which evenly distributed the space around the grid and made it more visually balanced. Additionally, I had to experiment with gap properties to ensure proper spacing between grid items while maintaining responsiveness.

5. Another challenge I faced was deciding how to handle tutorial materials for weeks that hadnâ€™t happened yet. I wanted to ensure that users could easily distinguish between available and unavailable materials while keeping the design intuitive. Instead of simply graying out unavailable weeks, I decided to create a CSS hover effect that would display a small "Coming Soon" message next to the cursor when a user hovered over those weeks. To achieve this, I researched different CSS techniques on the MDN website and found that I could combine the :hover pseudo-class with the ::after pseudo-element. By applying content: "Coming Soon"; in the ::after property, I was able to display a subtle message next to the hovered element. Additionally, I styled the message with position: absolute; and adjusted its placement to ensure it appeared smoothly beside the cursor.
